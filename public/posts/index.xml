      <description>Overview I have been working for ConvertKit for over a year now, and I haven&#39;t written a blog post in over two years. I&#39;m an infrastructure engineer at ConvertKit, which means I spend my working days looking at Linux terminals, and I&#39;m not to be trusted to do frontend work. Despite my lack of design skills, I&#39;ve been wanting to write more and publish articles on my own website. Since working at ConvertKit, I&#39;ve learned the importance of an email list, so I decided to challenge myself to rebuild my blog, integrate ConvertKit forms with it, and make it look good.</description>

Consul, Terraform, AWS Consul is an open source software created by Hashicorp used for service discovery, configuration management, DNS, KV storage, and more. It’s a powerful tool, and it’s worth learning.</description>
